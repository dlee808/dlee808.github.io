I chose to major in Management Information Systems because I was unsure of what to major in and I heard from people around me that it would be good for me. Now that I have found out more about MIS, I know that it will give me a lot of flexibility and opportunities in the future. Information systems will continue to be relevant in almost every industry and the blend of business and technology will be very useful.
